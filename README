PROJECT-		Simpler Validator jQuery Plugin (simplval)
COPYRIGHT-		2011 © Skyler Brungardt
AUTHOR-			Skyler Brungardt
CREATED-		03/29/11
NOTES-			This is a plugin for jQuery validation with more 
				simple validation than the existing plugins at the 
				time of its creation, allowing for more modular 
				implementation.  This plugin is meant to be 
				lightweight, with only the necessary parts - the 
				plugin will only return a true or false value based 
				upon if the field passes validation or not, and is 
				required or not.  For automatic error display, try 
				using the Thick Validator plugin (thickval), which 
				automatically displays errors appropriately if a 
				field fails validation.
REQUIREMENTS-	1.	Most any version of jQuery, recommended 1.2.6 or 
					greater.
				2.	The form element on which this validator is 
					called should have a unique ID attribute.
VERSION-		1.0.0:  Initial release.
